## What is Vexa?

**Vexa** is an open-source, self-hostable meeting transcription API and agent runtime for Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. Modular by design — twelve independent features, use one or all:

- **Meeting transcription API** — send a bot to any meeting, get real-time transcripts via REST API and WebSocket. Self-hosted alternative to Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai.
- **Meeting bot API** — auto-join, record, speak, chat, share screen. Open-source alternative to Recall.ai.
- **Agent runtime** — ephemeral containers for AI agents with zero idle cost. Post-meeting automation, scheduled pipelines.
- **MCP server** — 17 meeting tools for Claude, Cursor, Windsurf. Agents join calls, read transcripts, speak in meetings.

Every feature is a separate service. Pick what you need, skip what you don't. Self-host everything or use [vexa.ai](https://vexa.ai) hosted.

### At a glance

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Meeting bots** | Automatically joins Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom meetings |
| **Real-time transcription** | Sub-second transcript delivery during the call |
| **Interactive bots** | Make bots speak, send/read chat, share screen content, and set avatar in live meetings |
| **Agent runtime** | Ephemeral containers for AI agents — browser, agent, worker profiles. Zero cost when idle |
| **Post-meeting automation** | Meetings trigger action: summarize, create tickets, push to Slack/CRM — no human needed |
| **Proactive agents** | Scheduler + calendar integration: agents join meetings on schedule, act without being asked |
| **MCP server** | 17 tools for Claude/Cursor/Windsurf — join calls, read transcripts, speak in meetings |
| **Multilingual** | 100+ languages via Whisper (transcription + translation) |
| **Multi-tenant** | Users, scoped API tokens, isolated containers — deploy once, serve your team |
| **Self-hostable** | Run on your infra for complete data sovereignty |
| **Accessible anywhere** | Same agent via web dashboard, Telegram, meeting chat, or any chat client |

### Who it's for

| You are... | You want... |
|---|---|
| **Enterprises** | Self-hosted transcription with strict privacy — replace $17-20/seat SaaS |
| **AI product builders** | Give your agents meeting superpowers via MCP or API |
| **SaaS developers** | Multi-tenant meeting API to embed in your product |
| **Platform teams** | Deploy one service for your org — isolated agents, scoped tokens, no per-user infra |
| **Automation builders** | Post-meeting pipelines: meeting ends → agent summarizes → Slack/CRM/Linear |

---

## Build on Top. In Hours, Not Months

**Build powerful meeting assistants (like Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Fathom) for your startup, internal use, or custom integrations.** Or go further — build AI agents that don't just transcribe, but actively participate in and act on meetings.

The Vexa API provides powerful abstractions and a clear separation of concerns, enabling you to build sophisticated applications on top with a safe and enjoyable coding experience.

## 🛡️ Built for Data Sovereignty

Vexa is open-source and self-hostable — ideal for regulated industries and teams that cannot compromise on privacy. 

Modular architecture scales from edge devices to millions of users. You choose what to self-host and what to use as a service.

**You control everything:**

**1. Hosted service**
At [vexa.ai](https://vexa.ai) — get an API key and start sending bots. No infrastructure needed.
*<small style="color: #999;">Ready to integrate</small>*

<hr style="margin: 1.25em 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333;">

**2. Self-host with Vexa transcription**
Run Vexa yourself, use vexa.ai for transcription — ready to go, no GPU needed.
*<small style="color: #999;">Control with minimal DevOps</small>*

<hr style="margin: 1.25em 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333;">

**3. Fully self-host**
Run everything including your own GPU transcription service.
*<small style="color: #999;">Full data sovereignty for regulated industries</small>*


<a id="whats-new"></a>

## What's new

**Agent API (preview)**
- **Vexa CLI** — `vexa` replaces `claude` CLI, routes through ephemeral containers with persistent workspaces ([install](#vexa-cli))
- **Ephemeral agent containers** — browser, agent, worker profiles with zero idle cost
- **Agent API** — agent sessions, Claude CLI streaming, workspace sync, scheduling
- **Scheduler** — cron, relative delays, `on_success`/`on_failure` container chaining
- **Remote browser** — VNC + CDP, persistent auth across sessions

- **Dashboard agent chat** — talk to your agent from the web UI

**v0.9 (pre-release)**
- **Zoom:** initial Zoom Meeting SDK support (requires Zoom app setup/approval; see docs)
- **Recordings:** persist recording artifacts to S3-compatible storage (or local)
- **Post-meeting playback:** stream recordings via `/recordings/.../raw` with `Range` seeking (`206`) + `Content-Disposition: inline`
- **Delete semantics:** deleting a meeting also purges recording objects/artifacts (best-effort) before anonymizing the meeting
- **Interactive Bots API:** live controls for speak/chat/screen/avatar during active meetings
- **MCP server:** 17 tools for AI agents — join, transcribe, speak, chat, share screen

## Quickstart

### Option 1: Hosted (no deployment needed)

Get your API key at [vexa.ai/dashboard/api-keys](https://vexa.ai/dashboard/api-keys) and start sending bots immediately. No infrastructure needed.

### Option 2: Vexa Lite (recommended for self-hosting)

**Single Docker container. Easiest way to self-host Vexa.**

- **Self-hosted multiuser service** - Multiple users, API tokens, and team management
- **Single container** - Easy to deploy on any platform
- **No GPU required** - Transcription runs externally
- **Choose your frontend** - Pick from open-source user interfaces like [Vexa Dashboard](./services/dashboard)
- **Production-ready** - Stateless, scalable, serverless-friendly

Needs external Postgres + transcription service. Use Vexa transcription (sign up at [vexa.ai](https://vexa.ai) for a transcription API key — ready to go, no GPU needed), or self-host your own GPU transcription for full data sovereignty.

**Quick start:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name vexa \
  -p 8056:8056 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host/vexa" \
  -e ADMIN_API_TOKEN="your-admin-token" \
  -e TRANSCRIBER_URL="https://transcription.service" \
  -e TRANSCRIBER_API_KEY="transcriber-token" \
  vexaai/vexa-lite:latest
```

**Deployment options:**
- **One-click platform deployments**: [vexa-lite-deploy repository](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa-lite-deploy) (Fly.io ready, more platforms coming)
- **Complete setup guide**: [Vexa Lite Deployment Guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/vexa-lite-deployment)
- **Frontend options**: [Vexa Dashboard](./services/dashboard)

### Option 3: Docker Compose (development)

**Full stack deployment with all services. Perfect for development and testing.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa.git
cd vexa
make all
```

**What `make all` does:**
- Builds all Docker images
- Spins up all containers (API, bots, transcription services, database)
- Runs database migrations
- Starts a simple test to verify everything works

Full guide: [Deployment Guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/deployment)

### Option 4: Helm (production K8s)

For Kubernetes production deployments. See [deploy/helm/README.md](deploy/helm/README.md).

<a id="vexa-cli"></a>

### Vexa CLI

Local terminal client for the agent runtime. Works like `claude` but routes through ephemeral containers with persistent workspaces.

```bash
# Install
pip install "git+https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa.git#subdirectory=packages/vexa-cli"

# Configure
vexa config

# Chat (one-shot)
vexa -p "what files are in my workspace?"

# Chat (interactive REPL)
vexa

# Forward any claude CLI flags
vexa -p "review this" --flags "--effort high --permission-mode auto"
```

Sessions persist across container restarts. Workspace files sync to S3. See [packages/vexa-cli/README.md](packages/vexa-cli/README.md) for full docs.

### Recording storage (local and cloud)

Recording supports local filesystem, MinIO, and cloud S3-compatible backends.
See [Recording Storage](https://docs.vexa.ai/recording-storage) for configuration details.

<a id="agent-api"></a>

## Agent API

Vexa isn't just a meeting API — it's a runtime where AI agents natively understand meetings. No gluing together E2B sandboxes with Recall.ai webhooks. Meetings are a built-in primitive.

### What agents can do

| Capability | How |
|-----------|-----|
| **Join meetings** | `vexa meeting join --platform teams --url {url}` |
| **Transcribe live** | `vexa meeting transcript {id}` — streams segments in real-time |
| **Speak in meetings** | `vexa meeting speak --text "Here's the summary"` — TTS to meeting audio |
| **Read/write chat** | `vexa meeting chat --text "Action items..."` — interact via meeting chat |
| **Share screen** | `vexa meeting screen --type url --url {url}` — display content to participants |
| **Control browsers** | `vexa container spawn --profile browser` + CDP/Playwright automation |
| **Schedule pipelines** | `vexa schedule --cron "0 9 * * 1-5" chat "join standup, send notes"` |
| **Persist memory** | `vexa workspace save` — workspace survives across sessions |

### Specialist containers, not fat stacks

| Profile | RAM | Purpose | Idle cost |
|---------|-----|---------|-----------|
| **browser** | ~1.5GB | Meeting attendance, authenticated sessions, VNC + CDP | Zero — killed on timeout |
| **agent** | ~200MB | Claude CLI, summarization, automation, chat | Zero — killed on completion |
| **worker** | ~50MB | Webhook delivery, file processing, notifications | Zero — fire and forget |

The browser doesn't carry an agent. The agent doesn't carry Chromium. They connect via CDP over the network when needed, then die independently.

### Agents that act without being asked

```
Every weekday at 9am:
  → Browser container spawns, joins standup
  → Transcribes the meeting live
  → Meeting ends → agent container wakes up
  → Summarizes, creates Linear tickets, posts to #engineering
  → All containers die. Zero cost until tomorrow.
```

No human triggered anything. Calendar → scheduler → containers → business action.

### Multi-tenant by design

Unlike single-user agent tools (OpenClaw: "not a hostile multi-tenant security boundary," one VPS per user), Vexa runs as a multi-user service:

- **Isolated containers** per user, per session
- **Scoped API tokens** — `bot`, `tx`, `admin` enforced at gateway
- **User/team management** via Admin API
- **Deploy once**, serve your whole team — or your customer base

### MCP server — 17 meeting tools for AI agents

Connect Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client. Your agent gains meeting superpowers:

```
Tools: join_meeting, list_meetings, get_transcript, search_meetings,
       bot_speak, send_chat, read_chat, share_screen, set_avatar,
       start_recording, stop_recording, get_recording, list_bots,
       create_bot, stop_bot, get_bot_status, schedule_meeting
```

Other meeting MCP servers (Otter, Fireflies, Read.ai) are read-only. Vexa's is read + write + control — and self-hosted.

### Knowledge that builds itself from meetings

Every meeting makes your agent smarter. The [workspace knowledge template](./features/agentic-runtime/workspaces/) gives agents a file-based knowledge OS:

```
timeline.md          — logarithmic self-journal (past, present, future)
soul.md              — agent's understanding of you (what works, what doesn't)
streams/             — active working topics (flat .md files, wiki-linked)
notes.md             — inbox/scratchpad
knowledge/
  entities/
    contacts/        — people profiles, auto-extracted from meetings
    companies/       — org profiles
    products/        — product/project profiles
  meetings/          — meeting minutes, linked to entities
  action-items/      — tracked per meeting
scripts/             — automation scripts, scheduled via `vexa schedule`
```

After a meeting ends, the agent wakes up, reads the transcript, extracts entities into `knowledge/entities/`, creates meeting minutes with `[[wiki-links]]`, tracks action items, and updates the timeline. Like Obsidian + a CRM + a meeting assistant — but the agent does the work.

**How this compares:**

| Platform | Memory model | Meetings feed it? | Entity graph | Self-hosted |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| **OpenClaw** | MEMORY.md + SOUL.md (flat files) | No | No | Yes |
| **Mem0** | Vector + graph + KV (48K stars) | No | API-based | No (SaaS) |
| **Obsidian + AI** | Markdown + wiki-links | Manual | Manual | Yes (local) |
| **Clay/Attio** | CRM with AI enrichment | Via integrations | Yes | No |
| **Vexa Workspaces** | Markdown + wiki-links + entities + streams + timeline + soul | **Yes — automatic** | **Yes — contacts, companies, products** | **Yes** |

### Your agent, wherever you are

Same agent, same memory, every surface:

| Surface | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **Web dashboard** | Working — chat with your agent, see meetings, play recordings |
| **Telegram** | Working — message your agent from your phone |
| **Meeting chat** | Working — agent reads/responds in live meeting chat |
| **Slack/Discord** | Planned — same Agent API backbone |

## Meeting API — The Data Layer

The Meeting API is the foundation of the platform. It sends bots to meetings, captures real-time transcripts with per-speaker audio, and provides interactive controls (speak, chat, share screen). This is the data layer that feeds everything else — agents, webhooks, knowledge extraction.

### 1. Send bot to meeting:

Set `API_BASE` to your deployment:

- Hosted: `https://api.cloud.vexa.ai`
- Self-hosted Lite: `http://localhost:8056`
- Self-hosted full stack (default): `http://localhost:8056`

```bash
export API_BASE="http://localhost:8056"
```

### Request a bot for Microsoft Teams

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "teams",
    "native_meeting_id": "<NUMERIC_MEETING_ID>",
    "passcode": "<MEETING_PASSCODE>"
  }'
```

### Or request a bot for Google Meet

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "google_meet",
    "native_meeting_id": "abc-defg-hij"
  }'
```

### Or request a bot for Zoom

```bash
# Caveat: Zoom Meeting SDK apps typically require Marketplace approval to join other users' meetings.
# Before approval, expect you can reliably join only meetings created by you (the authorizing account).
#
# From URL: https://us05web.zoom.us/j/YOUR_MEETING_ID?pwd=YOUR_PWD
# Extract meeting ID and optional passcode separately.
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "zoom",
    "native_meeting_id": "YOUR_MEETING_ID",
    "passcode": "YOUR_PWD",
    "recording_enabled": true,
    "transcribe_enabled": true,
    "transcription_tier": "realtime"
  }'
```

### 2. Get transcripts:

### Get transcripts over REST

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  "$API_BASE/transcripts/<platform>/<native_meeting_id>"
```

For real-time streaming (sub‑second), see the [WebSocket guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/websocket).
For full REST details, see the [User API Guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/user_api_guide).

Note: Meeting IDs are user-provided (Google Meet code like `xxx-xxxx-xxx` or Teams numeric ID and passcode). Vexa does not generate meeting IDs.

## Architecture

**Core API services** (always running):

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [api-gateway](./services/api-gateway) | Reverse proxy — routes REST, WebSocket, VNC, CDP to backends |
| [admin-api](./services/admin-api) | User/org CRUD, scoped API tokens, team management |
| [meeting-api](./services/meeting-api) | **Data layer** — bot lifecycle, meeting CRUD, recordings, transcription collector, interactive bot controls |
| [agent-api](./services/agent-api) | **Intelligence layer** — agent sessions, Claude CLI streaming, workspace sync, scheduling |
| [runtime-api](./services/runtime-api) | **Infrastructure layer** — container CRUD, spawn/stop/exec, port mapping, idle timeout. Docker, Kubernetes, or process backend |

**Meeting & AI services:**

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [vexa-bot](./services/vexa-bot) | Joins meetings, captures per-speaker audio, transcribes, interactive controls |
| [transcription-service](./packages/transcription-service) | GPU inference — OpenAI-compatible Whisper API |
| [tts-service](./packages/tts-service) | Text-to-speech for bot voice |
| [mcp](./services/mcp) | 17-tool MCP server for AI agents (Claude, Cursor, etc.) |

**Frontends & clients:**

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [dashboard](./services/dashboard) | Open-source Next.js web UI — meetings, transcripts, agent chat, browser sessions |
| [telegram-bot](./services/telegram-bot) | Telegram client for agent interaction on mobile |

**Ephemeral containers** (spawned on demand, auto-reclaimed):

| Profile | RAM | Use case |
|---------|-----|----------|
| **browser** | ~1.5GB | Meeting attendance, authenticated browser sessions (VNC + CDP) |
| **agent** | ~200MB | Claude CLI, post-meeting processing, automation |
| **worker** | ~50MB | Webhook delivery, file processing |

- Database models: `libs/admin-models/` (users, tokens), `services/meeting-api/` (meetings, transcriptions)

<a id="runtime-api"></a>

### Runtime API — The Infrastructure Layer

The [Runtime API](./services/runtime-api) abstracts container lifecycle behind a single REST API. It's what allows Meeting API to spawn bot containers and Agent API to spawn agent sandboxes — without either caring whether the backend is Docker, Kubernetes, or bare processes.

`POST /containers` with a profile name → get a managed container back. It idles out automatically, fires a callback when it exits, and enforces per-user limits. Switch from Docker in dev to Kubernetes in prod by changing one env var.

## Modular — Pick What You Need

Vexa is a toolkit, not a monolith. Every feature works independently. Use one or all twelve — they compose when you need them to.

| You're building... | Features you need | Skip the rest |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Self-hosted Otter replacement** | transcription + multi-platform + webhooks | agent runtime, scheduler, MCP |
| **Meeting data pipeline** | transcription + webhooks + post-meeting | speaking-bot, chat, agent runtime |
| **AI meeting assistant product** | transcription + MCP + speaking-bot + chat | remote-browser, scheduler |
| **Proactive meeting agent** | scheduler + calendar + agentic-runtime + transcription | MCP, token-scoping |
| **Personal AI assistant** | agentic-runtime + workspaces + scheduler + Telegram | multi-platform, webhooks |
| **Meeting bot API (like Recall.ai)** | multi-platform + transcription + token-scoping | agent runtime, workspaces |

You don't pay complexity tax for features you don't use. Each service is a separate container. Don't need agents? Don't run agent-api. Don't need TTS? Don't run tts-service. The architecture is modular by design — services communicate via REST and Redis, not tight coupling.

## Features — Honest Status

Each feature has its own README with business context, competitive positioning, architecture, and validation gates. **Confidence scores are evidence-based** — 0 means untested, 90+ means validated with real tests. We update these continuously.
