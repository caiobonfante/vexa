## What is Vexa?

**Vexa** is an open-source, self-hostable API for real-time meeting transcription. It automatically joins Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom meetings, captures audio, and provides real-time transcriptions via REST API and WebSocket.

### At a glance

| Capability | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Meeting bots** | Automatically joins Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom meetings |
| **Real-time transcription** | Sub-second transcript delivery during the call |
| **Interactive bots** | Make bots speak, send/read chat, share screen content, and set avatar in live meetings |
| **Multilingual** | 100+ languages via Whisper (transcription + translation) |
| **API-first** | REST API + WebSocket streaming for integrations |
| **MCP-ready** | Connect AI agents (Claude/Cursor/etc.) through the MCP server |
| **Storage** | Persist transcripts + meeting metadata in your database |
| **Multi-user** | Team-ready: users, API keys/tokens, admin operations |
| **Self-hostable** | Run on your infra for complete data sovereignty |
| **User interfaces** | Open-source frontends (currently: **[Vexa Dashboard](./services/dashboard)**) |

### Who it's for

| You are... | You want... |
|---|---|
| **Enterprises** | Self-hosted transcription with strict privacy requirements |
| **Small & medium teams** | Simple deployment (Vexa Lite) with an open-source UI |
| **Developers** | Build meeting products (assistants, automations, analytics) on top of the API |
| **Automation builders** | Integrate with tools like n8n via webhooks / APIs |

---

## Build on Top. In Hours, Not Months

**Build powerful meeting assistants (like Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Fathom) for your startup, internal use, or custom integrations.**

The Vexa API provides powerful abstractions and a clear separation of concerns, enabling you to build sophisticated applications on top with a safe and enjoyable coding experience.

## 🛡️ Built for Data Sovereignty

Vexa is open-source and self-hostable — ideal for regulated industries and teams that cannot compromise on privacy. 

Modular architecture scales from edge devices to millions of users. You choose what to self-host and what to use as a service.

**You control everything:**

**1. Hosted service**
At [vexa.ai](https://vexa.ai) — get an API key and start sending bots. No infrastructure needed.
*<small style="color: #999;">Ready to integrate</small>*

<hr style="margin: 1.25em 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333;">

**2. Self-host with Vexa transcription**
Run Vexa yourself, use vexa.ai for transcription — ready to go, no GPU needed.
*<small style="color: #999;">Control with minimal DevOps</small>*

<hr style="margin: 1.25em 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid #333;">

**3. Fully self-host**
Run everything including your own GPU transcription service.
*<small style="color: #999;">Full data sovereignty for regulated industries</small>*


<a id="whats-new"></a>

## 🎉 What's new in v0.9 (pre-release)

- **Zoom:** initial Zoom Meeting SDK support (requires Zoom app setup/approval; see docs)
- **Recordings:** persist recording artifacts to S3-compatible storage (or local)
- **Post-meeting playback:** stream recordings via `/recordings/.../raw` with `Range` seeking (`206`) + `Content-Disposition: inline`
- **Delete semantics:** deleting a meeting also purges recording objects/artifacts (best-effort) before anonymizing the meeting
- **Interactive Bots API:** live controls for speak/chat/screen/avatar during active meetings
- **MCP integration docs:** end-to-end guide for connecting AI agents to Vexa tools

## Quickstart

### Option 1: Hosted (no deployment needed)

Get your API key at [vexa.ai/dashboard/api-keys](https://vexa.ai/dashboard/api-keys) and start sending bots immediately. No infrastructure needed.

### Option 2: Vexa Lite (recommended for self-hosting)

**Single Docker container. Easiest way to self-host Vexa.**

- **Self-hosted multiuser service** - Multiple users, API tokens, and team management
- **Single container** - Easy to deploy on any platform
- **No GPU required** - Transcription runs externally
- **Choose your frontend** - Pick from open-source user interfaces like [Vexa Dashboard](./services/dashboard)
- **Production-ready** - Stateless, scalable, serverless-friendly

Needs external Postgres + transcription service. Use Vexa transcription (sign up at [vexa.ai](https://vexa.ai) for a transcription API key — ready to go, no GPU needed), or self-host your own GPU transcription for full data sovereignty.

**Quick start:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name vexa \
  -p 8056:8056 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host/vexa" \
  -e ADMIN_API_TOKEN="your-admin-token" \
  -e TRANSCRIBER_URL="https://transcription.service" \
  -e TRANSCRIBER_API_KEY="transcriber-token" \
  vexaai/vexa-lite:latest
```

**Deployment options:**
- **One-click platform deployments**: [vexa-lite-deploy repository](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa-lite-deploy) (Fly.io ready, more platforms coming)
- **Complete setup guide**: [Vexa Lite Deployment Guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/vexa-lite-deployment)
- **Frontend options**: [Vexa Dashboard](./services/dashboard)

### Option 3: Docker Compose (development)

**Full stack deployment with all services. Perfect for development and testing.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa.git
cd vexa
make all
```

**What `make all` does:**
- Builds all Docker images
- Spins up all containers (API, bots, transcription services, database)
- Runs database migrations
- Starts a simple test to verify everything works

Full guide: [Deployment Guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/deployment)

### Option 4: Helm (production K8s)

For Kubernetes production deployments. See [deploy/helm/README.md](deploy/helm/README.md).

### Recording storage (local and cloud)

Recording supports local filesystem, MinIO, and cloud S3-compatible backends.
See [Recording Storage](https://docs.vexa.ai/recording-storage) for configuration details.

## 1. Send bot to meeting:

Set `API_BASE` to your deployment:

- Hosted: `https://api.cloud.vexa.ai`
- Self-hosted Lite: `http://localhost:8056`
- Self-hosted full stack (default): `http://localhost:8056`

```bash
export API_BASE="http://localhost:8056"
```

### Request a bot for Microsoft Teams

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "teams",
    "native_meeting_id": "<NUMERIC_MEETING_ID>",
    "passcode": "<MEETING_PASSCODE>"
  }'
```

### Or request a bot for Google Meet

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "google_meet",
    "native_meeting_id": "abc-defg-hij"
  }'
```

### Or request a bot for Zoom

```bash
# Caveat: Zoom Meeting SDK apps typically require Marketplace approval to join other users' meetings.
# Before approval, expect you can reliably join only meetings created by you (the authorizing account).
#
# From URL: https://us05web.zoom.us/j/YOUR_MEETING_ID?pwd=YOUR_PWD
# Extract meeting ID and optional passcode separately.
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "zoom",
    "native_meeting_id": "YOUR_MEETING_ID",
    "passcode": "YOUR_PWD",
    "recording_enabled": true,
    "transcribe_enabled": true,
    "transcription_tier": "realtime"
  }'
```

## 2. Get transcripts:

### Get transcripts over REST

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: <API_KEY>" \
  "$API_BASE/transcripts/<platform>/<native_meeting_id>"
```

For real-time streaming (sub‑second), see the [WebSocket guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/websocket).
For full REST details, see the [User API Guide](https://docs.vexa.ai/user_api_guide).

Note: Meeting IDs are user-provided (Google Meet code like `xxx-xxxx-xxx` or Teams numeric ID and passcode). Vexa does not generate meeting IDs.

## Who Vexa is for

* **Enterprises (self-host):** Data sovereignty and control on your infra
* **Teams using hosted API:** Fastest path from meeting to transcript
* **n8n/indie builders:** Low-code automations powered by real-time transcripts
