# Bot Lifecycle

> Procs: `tests2/src/bot.md`, `tests2/src/admit.md`, `tests2/src/finalize.md`

## What

Meeting bots join Google Meet / Teams, transcribe audio, and leave. Each bot is a Docker container running Playwright that navigates to a meeting URL, joins, captures audio, and reports state changes back to meeting-api via HTTP callbacks.

## Transition rules

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|----|---------|
| requested | joining | Bot callback |
| requested | failed | Validation error, spawn failure |
| requested | stopping | User DELETE |
| joining | awaiting_admission | Bot callback |
| joining | active | Bot callback (no waiting room) |
| joining | needs_human_help | Bot escalation |
| joining | failed | Platform error |
| awaiting_admission | active | Bot callback (admitted) |
| awaiting_admission | needs_human_help | Bot escalation |
| awaiting_admission | failed | Rejected, timeout |
| needs_human_help | active | User resolved via VNC |
| needs_human_help | failed | User gave up |
| active | stopping | User DELETE, scheduler timeout |
| active | completed | Bot self-exit (evicted, alone) |
| active | failed | Crash, disconnect |
| stopping | completed | Bot exit (any exit code during stopping = completed) |
| stopping | failed | Bot exit with error before stop processed |

## Completion reasons

| Reason | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| `stopped` | User called DELETE /bots |
| `awaiting_admission_timeout` | Waited > max_wait_for_admission |
| `awaiting_admission_rejected` | Host rejected bot from lobby |
| `left_alone` | No participants > max_time_left_alone |
| `evicted` | Host removed bot from meeting |
| `max_bot_time_exceeded` | Scheduler timeout fired |
| `validation_error` | Request validation failed |

## Failure stages

| Stage | When |
|-------|------|
| `requested` | Pre-spawn validation fails |
| `joining` | Platform join error (wrong URL, auth, network) |
| `awaiting_admission` | Waiting room error |
| `active` | Runtime crash after admission |

## Lifetime management

Meeting bots use **model 1** (consumer-managed) from runtime-api. `idle_timeout: 0` — runtime-api never auto-stops them. Meeting-api owns the full lifecycle through four mechanisms:

### 1. Server-side kill switch: scheduler job (max_bot_time)

When a bot is created, meeting-api schedules a deferred HTTP job in runtime-api's scheduler:
- `execute_at = now + max_bot_time` (default 2h)
- Job: `DELETE /bots/internal/timeout/{meeting_id}`
- When fired: sets `pending_completion_reason=MAX_BOT_TIME_EXCEEDED`, transitions to stopping
- Job cancelled when meeting reaches terminal state (completed/failed)

This is the **hard limit**. No meeting bot can run longer than `max_bot_time`.

### 2. Bot-side timers (client-enforced)

The bot process runs timers internally. When triggered, bot self-exits with a specific reason:

| Timer | Default | What happens |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `no_one_joined_timeout` | 120s (2min) | Nobody joined after bot entered meeting → exit |
| `max_wait_for_admission` | 900s (15min) | Stuck in lobby → exit |
| `max_time_left_alone` | 900s (15min) | All participants left → exit |

Bot exit → Docker "die" event → runtime-api `on_exit` → meeting-api exit callback → status updated.

### 3. User DELETE

`DELETE /bots/{platform}/{native_id}` → Redis `{"action": "leave"}` → bot exits → completed.

### 4. Platform events

Bot detects: evicted by host, meeting ended, connection lost → self-exit with appropriate reason.

### Timeout configuration

Resolution order: per-request `automatic_leave` → `user.data.bot_config` → system defaults.

| Timeout | Default | Enforced by | Configurable |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `max_bot_time` | 7,200,000ms (2h) | Scheduler job (server) | per-request, per-user |
| `max_wait_for_admission` | 900,000ms (15min) | Bot timer (client) | per-request, per-user |
| `max_time_left_alone` | 900,000ms (15min) | Bot timer (client) | per-request, per-user |
| `no_one_joined_timeout` | 120,000ms (2min) | Bot timer (client) | per-request, per-user |

### Contrast with other container types

| | Meeting bot | Browser session | Agent |
|---|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Who manages lifetime | meeting-api | gateway (planned) | agent-api |
| Server-side kill | scheduler job (max_bot_time) | idle_timeout (planned) | idle_timeout (300s) |
| Client-side kill | bot timers (alone, admission, join) | none | none |
| Heartbeat | none needed (scheduler is the safety net) | gateway /touch on /b/* traffic (planned) | agent-api /touch |
| runtime-api idle_timeout | 0 (disabled) | >0 (planned) | 300s |

## Delayed stop mechanism

When user calls DELETE /bots or scheduler fires:
1. Send Redis command `{"action": "leave"}` to bot
2. Transition to `stopping`
3. Schedule `_delayed_container_stop(container_name, meeting_id, delay=90s)`
4. If bot exits naturally within 90s → exit callback fires → completed
5. If 90s expires → force stop container → safety finalizer sets completed

Browser sessions: delay = 0s (no meeting to leave).

## Callbacks (bot → meeting-api)

| Endpoint | Called when |
|----------|-----------|
| `/bots/internal/callback/status_change` | Any state transition (unified) |
| `/bots/internal/callback/exited` | Bot process exits |
| `/bots/internal/callback/joining` | Bot navigating to meeting |
| `/bots/internal/callback/awaiting_admission` | Bot in lobby |
| `/bots/internal/callback/started` | Bot admitted, active |

All callbacks: 3 retries, exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s), 5s timeout per attempt.

Status transitions are protected by `SELECT FOR UPDATE` (row-level lock) to prevent TOCTOU races.

## Components

| Component | File | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| Bot creation | `services/meeting-api/meeting_api/meetings.py:598-1011` | POST /bots, spawn container |
| Status callbacks | `services/meeting-api/meeting_api/callbacks.py` | Bot → meeting-api state updates |
| Stop/timeout | `services/meeting-api/meeting_api/meetings.py:1269-1440` | DELETE /bots, scheduler timeout |
| Bot core | `services/vexa-bot/core/src/platforms/shared/meetingFlow.ts` | Join, admit, capture flow |
| Unified callback | `services/vexa-bot/core/src/services/unified-callback.ts` | Bot → API state reporting |
| Scheduler | `services/runtime-api/runtime_api/scheduler.py` | max_bot_time enforcement |

## DoD

| # | Check | Weight | Ceiling | Status | Last |
|---|-------|--------|---------|--------|------|
| 1 | POST /bots creates bot, returns id | 15 | ceiling | PASS | 2026-04-07 |
| 2 | Bot reaches active in live meeting | 20 | ceiling | PASS | 2026-04-07 |
| 3 | DELETE /bots → stopping → completed, container removed | 15 | ceiling | PASS | 2026-04-07 |
| 4 | Status visible via GET /bots/status (not 422) | 10 | — | PASS | 2026-04-07 |
| 5 | Timeout auto-stop (no_one_joined or max_bot_time) | 10 | — | UNTESTED | |
| 6 | Works for GMeet, Teams, browser_session | 10 | — | PASS | 2026-04-07 |
| 7 | Successful meeting never shows "failed" | 10 | — | PASS | 2026-04-07 |
| 8 | Auto-admit reliable (multi-phase CDP) | 10 | — | PASS | 2026-04-07 |
| 9 | Unauthenticated GMeet join (name prompt) | 5 | — | FAIL | 2026-04-07 |
| 10 | meeting_url parsed server-side (6 Teams formats) | 5 | — | PASS | 2026-04-07 |

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix | Learned |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bot shows "failed" after successful meeting | exit_code=1 on self_initiated_leave treated as failure | callbacks.py: exit during stopping → completed | Graceful leave ≠ crash |
| Bot stuck on name input (unauthenticated GMeet) | No saved cookies, Google shows "Your name" prompt | Bot should fill name or fail fast | Open bug |
| Auto-admit clicks text node instead of button | `text=/Admit/i` matched non-clickable element | Multi-phase CDP: panel → expand → `button[aria-label^="Admit "]` | Always use element-type + aria-label for clicks |
| "Waiting to join" section collapsed | Google Meet collapses lobby list after ~10s | Expand before looking for admit button | Check visibility before assuming DOM state |
