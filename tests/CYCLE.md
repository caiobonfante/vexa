# Test Cycle: Bottom-Up Sequential Validation

The most thorough, human-gated test approach. Not the only way -- `make test-unit` and `make test-all` exist for quick runs. Use the cycle for pre-release, after major changes, or when you need confidence.

**How it works:**
1. Agent presents the step -- WHY, WHAT, HOW
2. Agent runs it
3. Agent presents results AND tells human what to look at -- gaps, risks, findings
4. Human validates -- approves, asks questions, or says fix it
5. Next step

## Principles

1. **Isolate, then chain.** Test each service completely alone first (unit, start, verify). Start from services with no dependencies (transcription-service -- standalone GPU inference). Only then test things that depend on it. If the chain fails, you already know the foundation works -- the problem is in the dependent or the connection.

2. **Bottom-up by dependency.** Start at the foundation, work up. Never test something whose foundation is unverified.

3. **Every service has THREE gates:**
   - **Unit tests pass** -- code logic is sound
   - **README exists with WHY/WHAT/HOW** -- documented for humans
   - **Hot test passes** -- the service actually runs and does its job

   If any gate fails, the step fails. Fix it before moving on.

4. **Chain tests follow isolation tests.** After service A passes and service B passes, test A->B as a chain. The chain test verifies the connection, not the individual services.

5. **Test objectives per service:** throughput, quality, dev experience, clean code, robustness/stability, security, compatibility, recovery, configuration validation, observability.

6. **Results go to TWO places:** the service's `tests/results/` (local) AND repo's `tests/*/results/` (central). Baselines in `tests/load/results/README.md` must be updated.

7. **Findings feed back into docs.** Every finding -- security gaps, code issues, missing docs -- gets documented. If it changes how we test, update CYCLE.md. If it changes a service, update its README.

8. **Code without docs is untested code.** Missing README blocks the gate.

9. **Docs must be validated.** Documented commands that don't work are bugs. Follow the README -- if a step fails, it's a finding.

## Service dependency graph

```
shared-models              <- library, no deps
     |
transcription-service      <- standalone, GPU inference behind API
     |
Bot (per-speaker pipeline) <- depends on transcription-service + Redis
     |
admin-api                  <- depends on Postgres + shared-models
transcription-collector    <- depends on Redis + Postgres
     |
bot-manager                <- depends on Redis + Postgres + admin-api
     |
api-gateway                <- depends on admin-api + bot-manager + Redis
     |
dashboard                  <- depends on api-gateway + admin-api
```

---

## Phase 1: Code quality (no Docker)

Test code logic in isolation. Bottom of dependency graph first.

### 1.1 shared-models
**WHY:** Foundation -- every service imports it.
**Gates:** 39 unit tests + library (no README gate).
```bash
cd libs/shared-models && python -m pytest shared_models/test_*.py -v
```

### 1.2 transcription-service

**1.2a Unit tests**
**WHY:** Transcription logic -- hallucination detection, silence filtering, config parsing.
**Gates:** 30 unit tests + README with WHY/WHAT/HOW.
```bash
cd services/transcription-service && pytest tests/ -v
```

**1.2b Hot isolation test**
**WHY:** Unit tests prove logic. Now prove it actually transcribes.
```bash
bash tests/test_hot.sh --full    # start -> verify -> basic load -> stop
```
**Look at:** Transcript quality (coherent, not garbage), latency vs baseline, README port matches actual.

**1.2c Stress test**
**WHY:** Find real capacity limits -- concurrency curve, audio sizes, GPU utilization.
```bash
bash tests/test_stress.sh
```
**Look at:** At what concurrency does quality degrade? Per-worker VRAM (not total machine). Memory growth.
**Baselines:** Single: ~0.17s GPU. 40 concurrent (2 workers): 100% success. Queue limit: ~20/worker.

**1.2d Agent-driven deep test**
**WHY:** Security, compatibility, recovery, observability -- things scripts can't judge.
```bash
# Agent reads tests/AGENT_TEST.md and executes all 6 tests
```
**Look at:** Auth enforcement, OpenAI API compatibility, worker crash recovery, log quality.

### 1.3 Bot (per-speaker pipeline)

**1.3a Unit tests**
**WHY:** Per-speaker buffer management — confirmation logic, fuzzy matching, hard cap flush.
**Gates:** Unit tests + README with WHY/WHAT/HOW.
```bash
cd services/vexa-bot/core && npx tsx src/services/__tests__/speaker-streams.test.ts
```

**1.3b Mock meeting test**
**WHY:** Test the full per-speaker pipeline without a real meeting.
**Prerequisite:** transcription-service + Redis running.
```bash
# Start backend
docker compose up -d redis
cd services/transcription-service && docker compose up -d

# Serve mock meeting (3 speakers: Alice, Bob, Carol -- Edge TTS audio)
cd services/vexa-bot/tests/mock-meeting && bash serve.sh

# Run bot against mock meeting
cd services/vexa-bot/core
MEETING_URL=http://localhost:8080 npm run dev

# Verify segments in stream (payload format with JWT)
redis-cli XRANGE transcription_segments - + | head -20

# Verify speaker events in stream (flat fields)
redis-cli XRANGE speaker_events_relative - + | head -20

# Verify collector stored segments in hash
redis-cli HGETALL meeting:<meeting_id>:segments
```
**Look at:**
- 3 separate streams discovered (not mixed)
- Each speaker's segments have correct speaker label in payload (`segments[].speaker`)
- Segments have `completed: false` (drafts) and `completed: true` (confirmed)
- No cross-contamination (Alice's words don't appear in Bob's segments)
- Speaker events have correct event_type (SPEAKER_START/SPEAKER_END) and relative timestamps
- Bot's own name is NOT in the speaker list (filtered by speaker-identity.ts)

**1.3c Dashboard end-to-end test**
**WHY:** Verify the full pipeline from dashboard bot launch to live transcript display.
**Prerequisite:** All services running (`docker compose up -d`), dashboard on :3001.
```bash
# Launch bot from dashboard UI to a real meeting
# Verify in collector logs:
docker logs vexa_dev-transcription-collector-1 --tail 20 | grep -E "producer|Stored|Published|mutable"

# Verify via API:
curl -s http://localhost:8056/transcripts/google_meet/<native_id> -H "X-API-Key: <key>" | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'{len(d[\"segments\"])} segments'); [print(f'  {s[\"speaker\"]} | {s[\"text\"][:80]}') for s in d['segments'][-5:]]"
```
**Look at:**
- Segments appear in dashboard within ~3s of speech (draft latency)
- Speaker names are real participant names, not "Presentation" for everything
- `PRODUCER_LABELED` in collector logs (not `MULTIPLE_CONCURRENT_SPEAKERS`)
- Confirmed segments replace drafts (same start_time key, completed=true)

### 1.5 admin-api
**WHY:** User/token store. JSONB merge bug guard.
**Gates:** 43 unit tests + README.
```bash
cd services/admin-api && pytest tests/ -v
```

### 1.6 transcription-collector
**WHY:** Segment persistence. Filter quality.
**Gates:** 46 unit tests + README.
```bash
cd services/transcription-collector && pytest tests/ -v
```

### 1.7 api-gateway
**WHY:** External API entry point. Route and auth enforcement.
**Gates:** 35 unit tests + README.
```bash
cd services/api-gateway && pytest tests/ -v
```

### 1.8 Remaining services
**tts-service:** 16 unit tests + README.
**mcp:** 53 unit tests + README.
**dashboard:** README check (no unit tests -- UI service).

### 1.9 README validation
**WHY:** Docs must be accurate post-architecture change.
**Check each service README for:**
- Bot README reflects per-speaker pipeline
- Transcription-service README mentions repetition_penalty
- Collector README reflects bot-published segments
- redis.md reflects bot as stream producer

### Phase 1 Gate
**All unit tests pass. All READMEs have WHY/WHAT/HOW. Standalone services hot-tested.**

---

## Phase 2: Service isolation (Docker, one at a time)

Start services in dependency order. Each must be healthy before its dependents start.

### 2.1 Infrastructure
```bash
docker compose up -d postgres redis
```
**Verify:** `pg_isready`, `redis-cli ping`.

### 2.2 admin-api
```bash
docker compose up -d admin-api
```
**Verify:** health check, CRUD operations, auth enforcement.

### 2.3 transcription-service
```bash
docker compose up -d transcription-service
```
**Verify:** health check, send audio, get transcript back.

### 2.4 transcription-collector
```bash
docker compose up -d transcription-collector
```
**Verify:** consuming Redis stream, persisting to Postgres.

### 2.5 bot-manager
```bash
docker compose up -d bot-manager
```
**Verify:** health check, bot launch capability.

### 2.6 api-gateway
```bash
docker compose up -d api-gateway
```
**Verify:** routing, auth enforcement, WebSocket proxy.

### 2.7 dashboard
```bash
docker compose up -d dashboard
```
**Verify:** pages load, no console errors.

### Phase 2 Gate
**All services healthy. Basic operations verified.**

---

## Phase 3: Functionality chains

Verify the data flows that make the product work.

### 3.1 Transcription chain (THE HOT PATH)
```
audio -> bot (per-speaker) -> HTTP POST -> transcription-service -> text
  -> XADD {payload} -> Redis stream -> collector -> Redis hash -> PUBLISH tc:meeting:{id}:mutable
  -> api-gateway (WebSocket) -> dashboard (live transcript)
  -> collector background flush -> Postgres -> API (GET /transcripts)
```
**Test with dashboard bot launch to a real meeting.**
**Verify:**
```bash
# Collector logs show producer-labeled speaker
docker logs vexa_dev-transcription-collector-1 --tail 20 | grep -E "producer|Stored|Published"

# API returns segments with correct speakers
curl -s localhost:8056/transcripts/google_meet/<native_id> -H "X-API-Key: <key>" | python3 -m json.tool | head -30

# Redis hash has segments (before Postgres flush)
redis-cli HGETALL meeting:<id>:segments | head -20
```
**Look at:**
- Drafts appear in dashboard within ~3s (completed=false via XADD → collector → pub/sub)
- Confirmed segments replace drafts (completed=true, same start_time key)
- Speaker names are producer-labeled (PRODUCER_LABELED, not MULTIPLE_CONCURRENT_SPEAKERS)
- Collector persists to Postgres after 30s immutability threshold
- API returns transcript with speaker attribution from both Redis (mutable) and Postgres (immutable)
- Hallucination filter catches known junk phrases

### 3.2 Webhook delivery
```
meeting event -> bot-manager -> webhook fired -> customer endpoint
```
**Verify:**
- Status change (joining, active, completed) triggers webhook
- Failed delivery goes to Redis retry queue
- Retry worker re-delivers successfully
- `redis-cli llen webhook_retry_queue` drains to 0

### 3.3 API chain
```
authenticate -> create token -> list meetings -> get transcript with speakers
```
**Verify:**
- Token creation via admin-api
- Bot launch via api-gateway
- Transcript retrieval with speaker labels
- Meeting list includes correct metadata

### 3.4 Real-time delivery
```
bot XADD {payload} -> collector -> PUBLISH tc:meeting:{id}:mutable -> api-gateway (subscribe) -> WebSocket -> dashboard
```
**Verify:**
- WebSocket connection to api-gateway succeeds
- Draft segments appear on WebSocket within ~3s of speech (completed=false)
- Confirmed segments replace drafts (completed=true, same start_time)
- Multiple concurrent WebSocket clients receive same segments
- Connection survives brief network interruption

### 3.5 Speaker identification
```
per-speaker audio tracks -> DOM name resolution (filtered: bot self + UI junk) -> VAD -> transcription -> labeled segments
```
**Verify:**
- Each speaker gets distinct label in transcript (real participant names)
- Bot's own name is NOT in speaker list (filtered by speaker-identity.ts)
- No cross-contamination between speakers
- Speaker events on `speaker_events_relative` stream have correct event_type and relative timestamps
- Screen share tracks (extra audio elements beyond tile count) labeled "Presentation"
- Collector uses producer-labeled speaker (`PRODUCER_LABELED` in logs)

### Phase 3 Gate
**All functionality chains work end-to-end.**

---

## Phase 4: User experience flows

### 4.1 Self-hoster: README to first transcript
```
git clone -> follow README -> make all -> join meeting -> get transcript
```
**Verify:**
- README instructions work without modification
- All services start successfully
- Bot can join a mock meeting
- Transcript appears in API response

### 4.2 API user: token to transcript
```
create API token -> launch bot via API -> poll for transcript -> get result with speakers
```
**Verify:**
- Token creation flow works
- Bot launch returns meeting ID
- Polling endpoint shows transcript appearing
- Final transcript has speaker labels

### 4.3 Dashboard: login to live transcript
```
open dashboard -> log in -> see meetings -> click meeting -> see live transcript with speakers
```
**Verify:**
- Dashboard loads without errors
- Meeting list populates
- Clicking a meeting shows transcript
- Live segments appear via WebSocket during active meeting

### Phase 4 Gate
**All user experience flows complete successfully.**

---

## Phase 5: Stress and load

### 5.1 transcription-service capacity
```bash
cd services/transcription-service && bash tests/test_stress.sh
```
**Baselines:** Single: ~0.17s GPU. 40 concurrent (2 workers): 100% success. Queue limit: ~20/worker.

### 5.2 Bot scaling (K8s)

**Unit of scale:** 1 bot pod = 250m CPU request, 600Mi RAM request (measured 2026-03-12).

**Node: g6-standard-6 (Linode/Akamai LKE)**
- Allocatable: 4 CPU, ~8GB RAM
- Services overhead: ~1.6 CPU, ~3.5GB (gateway, admin-api, bot-manager, collector, mcp, dashboard, redis, caddy, tx-gateway, webapp)
- Node 1 (with services): **7 bots** (RAM-limited)
- Additional nodes (bots only): **13 bots each** (RAM-limited)

**Scaling table:**

| Nodes | Bot capacity | Cumulative provision time |
|-------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 1     | 7           | 0 (existing)             |
| 2     | 20          | ~90s                     |
| 3     | 33          | ~90s                     |
| 5     | 59          | ~90s each                |
| 8     | 98          | ~90s each                |
| 9     | 111         | 100+ target              |

**Cold start for new node:** ~2-3 min (90s provision + 60s image pull for 2GB bot image).

**Burst scenario — 100 bots at once:**
1. First 7 on existing node → instant
2. Bots 8-100 go Pending → autoscaler requests ~7 nodes in parallel
3. All nodes ready in ~90s, images pulled in ~60s
4. All 100 bots running in **~2.5 minutes**

**Bottleneck analysis at 100 concurrent bots:**

| Component | Load | Limit | Breaks at |
|-----------|------|-------|-----------|
| **Transcription service (GPU)** | 100 concurrent POST | 2 workers × 20 queue = 40 | **~40 bots** |
| Collector (stream consumer) | ~300 segments/s | Single-threaded | ~200 bots |
| Redis XADD | ~300/s | 100K+/s | Never |
| Postgres writes | ~3000/10s batch | Managed DB handles | ~500+ bots |
| Network (audio to BBB) | 100 × 50KB/s = 5MB/s | 1Gbps | Never |
| Caddy ingress (WS) | Dashboard connections | Thousands | Never |

**Primary bottleneck: transcription-service at ~40 bots.** Fix: scale GPU workers (5 workers = 100 concurrent) or use Fireworks AI as overflow via TX gateway.

**Mitigation for production scale:**
1. **LKE autoscaler**: min=1, max=10 nodes
2. **Image pre-pull**: DaemonSet to pre-pull vexa-bot image on every node
3. **Buffer node**: overprovisioner pod (low-priority) keeps 1 empty node warm
4. **Ramp limit**: bot-manager queues launches, max N concurrent provisions
5. **GPU scaling**: 5 transcription workers for 100 bots, or Fireworks overflow

### 5.3 Load test plan

**Setup:**
1. Create N test users with API keys via admin-api
2. Create test Google Meet rooms (or mock meetings)
3. Ramp: 5 → 10 → 25 → 50 → 100 bots

**Measure at each step:**
- Per-bot CPU/RAM (kubectl top)
- Node count and autoscaler events
- Transcription latency (bot log timestamps: audio → draft → confirmed)
- Redis stream lag (XLEN, consumer group pending)
- Collector processing rate (segments/s in logs)
- DB write rate and latency
- Dashboard WebSocket delivery latency
- Transcription service queue depth and error rate

**Pass criteria:**
- No bot OOM kills
- No transcription service 5xx > 1%
- Draft latency < 5s at all levels
- Autoscaler provisions nodes before Pending > 60s
- No data loss (all segments reach Postgres)

### Phase 5 Gate
**No regression >20% from baselines. Bottlenecks identified and documented. Scaling plan for 100+ bots validated.**

---

## Phase 6: Builds and packages

### 6.1 Docker images
```bash
# All service images build successfully
docker compose build
```
**Verify:** No build failures, no warnings about missing files.

### 6.2 Vexa-lite
```bash
cd services/vexa-lite && docker build -t vexa-lite .
```
**Verify:** Image builds, container starts, health check passes.

### 6.3 Helm charts
```bash
cd charts && helm lint charts/vexa/ && helm lint charts/vexa-lite/
```
**Verify:** No lint errors. Template rendering with default values succeeds.

### 6.4 Version consistency
**Verify:** Docker image tags, Helm chart versions, and package.json versions are consistent.

### Phase 6 Gate
**All builds succeed. Helm lint passes.**

---

## Phase 7: Audit (code, not runtime)

```bash
make audit    # security + config + architecture + staleness
```

Plus agent-driven:
- Docs validation (follow every README)
- Security deep review
- Dev experience assessment

### 7.1 Security audit
```bash
python tests/audit/security_audit.py
```
**Look at:** New findings vs last run.

### 7.2 Configuration audit
```bash
python tests/audit/config_audit.py
```
**Look at:** Undocumented env vars, dev defaults in production config.

### 7.3 Architecture compliance
```bash
python tests/audit/architecture_audit.py
```
**Look at:** Stateless services, token scoping, durable delivery, self-hostable.

### 7.4 Staleness audit
```bash
python tests/audit/staleness_audit.py
```
**Look at:** Dead code, orphaned files, stale docs.

### Phase 7 Gate
**0 errors. Warnings reviewed by human.**

---

## Phase 8: Report to Human

```
Phase 1: X/Y services pass (N total tests)
Phase 2: X/Y services healthy
Phase 3: X/Y functionality chains work
Phase 4: X/Y UX flows complete
Phase 5: baselines held / regressed
Phase 6: X/Y builds succeed
Phase 7: N new findings, M resolved
```

**Human decides: commit, fix more, or investigate.**

---

## Key learnings from previous cycles

1. **Audio format matters.** Bot sends Float32Array, not Int16 PCM. Sending wrong format = hallucinated garbage, not an error. Silent corruption.
2. **Test compose needs exact config.** DNS (`extra_hosts`), API keys matching between services, correct env vars. Budget 3-4 iterations for new test compose files.
3. **Transcription service LIFO is not a bug.** Under load, it intentionally skips old audio to stay current. "Missing segments" at high concurrency = LIFO working as designed, not silent failure.
4. **Per-worker queue limit (~20) is the transcription-service bottleneck.** Not GPU, not memory. Software limit.
5. **GPU memory reported by nvidia-smi is machine-wide.** Filter to per-process: `nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps=pid,used_memory --format=csv`.
6. **Missing README = failed gate.** Not optional. 4 services were missing READMEs and should have blocked Phase 1.
7. **DOM is still needed for speaker names.** Audio tracks give you separation, DOM gives you labels. One-time lookup per participant, not continuous polling.
8. **Edge TTS generates good test audio.** Three distinct neural voices (Jenny, Guy, Sonia), different content, transcribes perfectly. Use for mock meeting dev environment.
9. **Bot posts directly to transcription-service via HTTP.** The per-speaker pipeline does not need any intermediary.
10. **Zod schema strips unknown fields.** `docker.ts` uses `BotConfigSchema.parse()` — any field not in the schema is silently dropped from BOT_CONFIG. New config fields MUST be added to the Zod schema or they won't reach the bot code.
11. **Bot name filtering is required.** `__vexaGetAllParticipantNames()` returns all DOM tiles including the bot itself and UI text ("Let participants send messages"). speaker-identity.ts must filter these before positional mapping to audio elements.
12. **Draft/confirmed is the latency solution.** Publish drafts (`completed=false`) on every transcription result (~3s latency). Confirmed segments (`completed=true`) replace drafts after stabilization. Both flow through XADD → collector → pub/sub → dashboard. Same Redis hash key (start_time) so drafts update in place.
13. **Transcription service URL is bot-manager config.** Passed via `BOT_CONFIG.transcriptionServiceUrl` (same pattern as `redisUrl`). Docker containers need `ExtraHosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to reach host services. K8s uses cluster DNS — no ExtraHosts needed.
14. **Collector must use producer-labeled speaker.** When segment payload includes `speaker` field, collector should use it directly (`PRODUCER_LABELED`) instead of running the overlap-based speaker mapper which picks wrong speaker when multiple are active simultaneously.
